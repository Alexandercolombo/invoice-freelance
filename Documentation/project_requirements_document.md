**Project Requirements Document (PRD)**

**1. Project Overview**

The project's objective is to develop a professional invoice system aimed at freelancers and contractors, enabling them to manage their work tasks and generate polished invoices efficiently. This tool is explicitly crafted for Don Russell of DR3 Tech Group, yet is robust enough to be customized for use by other businesses. The principal problem it addresses is the inefficiency in current invoicing systems that are often cluttered by unnecessary features, complicating what should be a straightforward process of task tracking and invoice generation.

The key goals for this system include providing an intuitive user experience where simplicity and professionalism are paramount. It is built to be agile, allowing users to input tasks with ease, manage multiple clients, and generate invoices with a single click. Success for this project is measured by its ability to reduce administrative overhead for freelancers, its adaptability to various customization needs, and its professional invoice output—all while ensuring a seamless user journey from task entry to invoice completion.

**2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope**

**In-Scope:**

*   Business profile setup with basic information and optional branding.
*   Client management system, including details such as name and hourly rates.
*   Task recording system allowing precise tracking of work completed.
*   Invoice generation, providing a professional PDF format.
*   User-customizable options for branding invoices.

**Out-of-Scope:**

*   Integration with financial transaction software or direct payment processing.
*   Advanced time tracking or resource scheduling.
*   Multi-currency support or detailed tax calculations.
*   Team management features or complex user roles beyond single ownership.

**3. User Flow**

A new user begins by signing up for the system, where they are guided through an initial setup wizard to create their business profile. This setup includes entering their business name, optional branding items like logos, and payment instructions. After setup, users manage their clients by adding new client profiles, which may contain details such as hourly rates and optional addresses.

As users complete work tasks, they log these tasks under specific clients. They accumulate these tasks until they're ready to generate an invoice—often waiting until there's a significant amount of billable work. When ready, the user can generate an invoice by selecting accumulated tasks, previewing the invoice to ensure accuracy, and finally generating a professional PDF. The invoice format is simple yet professional, ensuring that the output meets client expectations, maintaining the flexibility of billing frequency that suits the freelancer’s workflow.

**4. Core Features**

*   User Authentication and Profile Customization: Facilitated via Clerk, offering seamless login and profile settings.
*   Client Management: A module that allows users to create, edit, and manage client information.
*   Task Tracking: Easily log tasks with partial hours and immediate real-time saving.
*   Invoice Generation: View preview and generate clean, professionally formatted invoices.
*   PDF Creation: Employs React Email and Puppeteer for high-quality PDF outputs.
*   Real-time Database: Uses Convex for up-to-date task management and client data.

**5. Tech Stack & Tools**

*   **Frontend Framework:** Next.js 14 (App Router)
*   **Backend and Database:** Convex for real-time data operations
*   **Authentication:** Clerk for managing user sessions and data
*   **User Interface Design:** Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI for responsive and aesthetic components
*   **Form Management:** React Hook Form combined with Zod for accuracy and validation
*   **PDF Generation:** React Email and Puppeteer to ensure professional document aesthetics
*   **IDE & AI Tools:** Replit for coding collaboration, Claude AI, and ChatGPT for enhanced code assistance and generation

**6. Non-Functional Requirements**

*   Performance should ensure quick task entry and instantaneous invoice generation.
*   High security for storing sensitive user information, with clear separation between user-stored data and task management.
*   Compliance with general data privacy standards, though explicit compliance with regulations like GDPR isn’t a priority due to not processing direct payments.
*   Usability standards focused on a clean UI that is responsive and intuitive, reducing user time-to-completion.

**7. Constraints & Assumptions**

*   Relies on external services like Convex and Clerk, hence dependent on their uptime and service availability.
*   Preference for web-based deployment, ensuring compatibility across browsers, though explicitly not optimized for mobile app deployment.
*   Assumes all users are comfortable managing tasks and clients through an online interface that may have occasional real-time data lags.

**8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls**

*   There might be challenges in ensuring seamless real-time updates across different devices if users sign-in and perform tasks on various platforms concurrently.
*   Platform restrictions, such as API rate limits, may appear if the usage exceeds initial traffic predictions.
*   Addressing usability on mobile can be an area that requires vigilance to avoid performance bottlenecks or non-responsive elements.
