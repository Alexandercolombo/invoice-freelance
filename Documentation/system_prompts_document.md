# System Prompt Document

## Introduction

This document serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding and utilizing system prompts within the professional invoice system application. System prompts are crucial in shaping how the AI interacts with users, ensuring seamless task management and professional invoice generation. The context of this project revolves around enhancing freelancers' invoicing processes by streamlining task recording and personalizing invoice outputs, providing a balance between functionality and simplicity.

## Purpose of System Prompts

System prompts are designed to guide AI behavior, ensuring it can offer clear and accurate support to users at every interaction point. They dictate how the AI should respond in various scenarios, ultimately influencing the user's experience through clarity, accuracy, and relevance. Crafting precise prompts is essential, as they determine the AI's capability to assist users in managing tasks, generating invoices, and personalizing their business profiles within the system.

## Prompt Structure and Guidelines

The prompts follow a structured format that ensures clarity and ease of understanding. Utilizing direct and concise language, prompts should be phrased positively and constructed to guide users through specific tasks. Consider the context of the AI's role, focus on the end-user's perspective, and tailor prompts to be contextually appropriate, facilitating an intuitive interaction without requiring deep technical understanding.

## Core System Prompts

**Onboarding Prompt**: "Welcome! Let's set up your business profile to get started with efficient invoicing. Please enter your business name, and payment instructions, and upload a logo if you have one."

**Task Entry Prompt**: "What task are you recording now? Include a brief description and the hours spent. You can input fractional hours like 0.25 or 0.5 for accuracy."

**Invoice Generation Prompt**: "Ready to create an invoice? Here's a preview of your unbilled tasks and their total amount. Confirm to generate a PDF invoice now."

Examples:

*   Onboarding: Guides the user through creating a vital business profile.
*   Task Entry: Prompts users to log tasks, emphasizing simplicity and precision.
*   Invoice Generation: Facilitates immediate invoice creation, showcasing clarity in billing.

## Role-Specific Prompts

**Customer Support Agent Prompt**: "How may I assist you with your invoicing needs today? Whether it's managing tasks, clients, or generating invoices, I'm here to help."

**Personal Optimization Assistant Prompt**: "Would you like suggestions on customizing your invoice templates to better reflect your business brand?"

These prompts tailor the AI's behavior based on the user's role or specific needs, enhancing personalized interaction through supportive and proactive assistance.

## Dynamic Prompts

Dynamic prompts adapt based on user inputs or existing system data, such as:

"Your current unbilled tasks total $X. Would you like to review them before generating an invoice?"

These prompts change contextually, ensuring relevance and assisting in decision-making by providing information relevant to the user's ongoing actions or preferences.

## Error Handling Prompts

**Error Prompt for Data Entry**: "It seems there was an error inputting your task details. Please check your inputs for accuracy. Remember, task hours should be a number, like 2.5."

**System Unavailability Prompt**: "We are currently experiencing high traffic. Your actions have been saved and will be processed shortly. Thank you for your patience."

These prompts maintain smooth user interactions by providing guidance without causing frustration, even when unexpected issues arise. They aim to quickly resolve misunderstandings and technical errors with clear, action-oriented feedback.

## Feedback and Improvement

User feedback is critical in refining system prompts over time. Users are encouraged to provide feedback on the clarity and helpfulness of prompts through in-app surveys or feedback forms. This feedback will be systematically reviewed to improve user interaction quality, ensuring the system evolves according to user needs and technological advancements.
